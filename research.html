<section id="mainright"> <article> <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<p align="justify">
In my research, I try to tackle open questions relating to the growth of
supermassive black holes and their host galaxies within the broader context of
galaxy evolution.
I take advantage of large datasets from space-based galaxy surveys such as
<a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~ksheth/S4G/Site/S4G_Home.html">S4G</a> and
<a href="http://cosmos.astro.caltech.edu">COSMOS</a>.
I'm interested in galaxies at high redshifts as well as those nearby.
Below, a summary of some relevant results.
</p>

<h3>AGN fueling in disk galaxies: beyond the local universe</h3>
<table> <tr> <td width="380" align="justify"
style="vertical-align:middle">
Today we know that a significant fraction of the BH growth is occurring in
undisturbed disk galaxies, even out to z=2. How do these AGN get their gas?
In our recent paper, we looked at the role of bars in AGN
fueling out to 7 billion years lookback time, and found that
active galaxies are barred only marginally more often than inactive galaxies,
and AGN in barred galaxies are equally luminous as those in unbarred galaxies.
We also see that most AGN at higher redshifts are hosted in unbarred galaxies,
meaning that, while bars can indeed provide a fresh supply of gas to the central
regions of a galaxy, other instabilities can also accomplish the same,
and the subsequent fueling will be
independent of whether a galaxy is barred or not.

<h3>Stellar bars and nuclear activity in nearby galaxies</h3>

Stellar bars are a viable mechanism to bring gas down and provide the fuel to feed a
supermassive black hole, yet thir actual relevance in this process in not completely
understood.
To better constrain the role of bar-driven inflows on AGN activity, we took a
new approach: using a sample of nearby barred galaxies from the
<a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~ksheth/S4G/Site/S4G_Home.html">S4G</a> survey,
we studied
whether there is any relation between bar strength -and hence gas inflow rate-
and degree of AGN activity.
We used Spitzer imaging to quantify the bar strength
from its structure and gravitational torque; and Chandra observations to measure
AGN luminosities and accretion rates. We found that stronger bars do not result in
brighter or more efficient nuclear activity, i.e., the ongoing AGN activity
is not closely connected to the stellar bar in the local universe.

<h3>Chasing the merger-AGN connection</h3>
<table> <tr> <td width="380" align="justify"
style="vertical-align:middle"> Major galaxy merging has been proposed as a plausible
mechanism to trigger black hole growth, yet its actual relevance remains unclear. In our
recent study, we set out to better understand this unresolved issue: using HST/ACS imaging
from the COSMOS survey, we analyzed the morphologies of large samples of active and
inactive galaxies, finding that both samples show a consistent merger fraction of roughly
15%. Together with the fact that the majority of the AGN hosts are disk-dominated,
not likely relics of old major mergers, our results explicitely show that major merging has
not been the dominant AGN fueling mechanism, at least for the last 8 billion years.<br />

<h3 align="right">The Black hole-galaxy relation over the last 7 billion years</h3>

Black hole mass-galaxy total stellar mass relation up to z=0.9, in agreement with

<td width="380" align="justify" style="vertical-align:middle">
Present-day galaxies are
closely connected to their supermassive black holes, but to understand how this
relation gets established, further observational constraints are required on how galaxy
and BH related at earlier times. In our recent study, we analyzed a large sample of AGN
out to z=0.9 from the COSMOS survey, allowing us to study in detail growing BHs together
with their host galaxies. We found that for these galaxies, BH mass scales with total
galaxy stellar mass in the same way as it does locally, at z=0, with galactic bulge mass.
It is likely that for these galaxies to obey the local relation only a disk-to-bulge
stellar mass redistribution is needed, likely driven by passive secular evolution. <br />
